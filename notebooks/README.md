**[Visualize Traffic Accidents in UK with Datashader](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Atlas7/visualize-traffic-accidents-in-uk/blob/master/notebooks/Visualize-Traffic-Accidents-in-UK-with-Datashader.ipynb)**: start with this one. It introduces you the power of big data visualization with Bokeh and Datashader, and other fundamental knowledges such as Geo Coordinates, Bounding Boxes, Web Mercator Projection, Plot Size, and more.

**[Visualize Traffic Accidents in UK by Road Types with Bokeh Datashader](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Atlas7/visualize-traffic-accidents-in-uk/blob/master/notebooks/Visualize-Traffic-Accidents-in-UK-by-Road-Types-With-Bokeh-Datashader.ipynb)**: Visualize UK Traffic Accident by Road Type. Use our own `utils` library to make our code smaller and more concise. Handy template Notebook.

**[Deploy Interactive Bokeh-Datashader Image as a Web Application](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Atlas7/visualize-traffic-accidents-in-uk/Deploy-Interactive-Bokeh-Datashader-Image-as-a-Web-Application.ipynb)**: contains some of my own searches on deploying a Bokeh-Datashader Interative Image as a Web Application. It appears Holoview and Bokeh Server combo might be a promising solution. Will keep this notebook updated.

**[Useful-Resources.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Atlas7/visualize-traffic-accidents-in-uk/blob/master/notebooks/Useful-Resources.ipynb)**: I use this notebook to keep track of useful links. Will be updated from time to time.
